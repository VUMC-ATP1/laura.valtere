# About me

The interesting part of my life is that the decisions I have made after school graduation and all my lifelong desire are very far away from each other…I’m always wanted to link my life with the IT field but something always got me far away from my aim.
5+ years ago I saw an interesting job advertisement, and it attract me, there was saying something like “If you are a true fairy, then come and join our wonderful friendly team…..”. So without thinking I sent my CV with the message “Are you still looking for a Fairy?” And BINGO! On the next day, I receive a call and an invitation for an interview. It was one of my spontaneous decisions, but this time finally connected with IT. This is how I joined an IT company as an Office Manager aka Fairy, as a purposeful and responsible person I worked hard and always looked for additional responsibilities, so after a year of hard work my labor was noticed, and I was raised to the HR manager. In the HR position, I have started my investigation journey in the IT field, and in the 2018 year I went on Master's level courses, and in 2020 I have finished the Master's Degree in Information System management. At the same time, My life changed on all 360° and I take a break from my career run till Autumn 2022, now I'm getting ready for a new start with the aim to receive new skills in Automation testing, which will increase my chances after maternity leave to start a new position in ongoing IT projects.

# Hobby?
I’m a gamer. I really enjoy those beautiful fantasy worlds. I do not imagine myself without at least 1-hour playing a game.
Also, I'm a true rider, the best mind and soul rest is while riding the BMW Z3 roadster or SUZUKI Marauder, 5 minutes of driving with good [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8GW1GaoIc) erased all the stress or bad emotions of the day.

# Dream?
Hmmm, My dream is till my 40s made a good financial pillow, and achieve a high passive income, so I can without stress rest on my own small island in the lagoon on my personal yacht.
